This is a repository for the programming with data class. It will be used to test out different functions in R and track any progress I make this semester.

# **Introduction**

 Hello! My name is Allison and I am a senior majoring in Psychology, I am taking this class because I think being able to use R will help when applying to grad schools.

## **Fun facts**

1. I'm from Maryland but have lived in Florida for 2 years now.
1. I'll be taking a year off once I graduate to gain more research experience
1. In my free time I paint and play guitar :)


 I look forward to a great semester and learning about coding with R!
